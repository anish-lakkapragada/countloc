# countloc

Simple library to count the lines of code in a directory (excluding stuff like ```node_modules```)

Simply just run: 
```shell
countloc node_modules <args>
```

to find the number of lines of code in the current directory (including subdirs), excluding 
any args (in the example above, ```node_modules```)

(use pygount instead lmao)
